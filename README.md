Once your profile is set up, you can start customizing your quiz!

  - "What’s my nickname?"
  
You can create as many questions as you want.

### 3. **Share Your Profile**

Once your profile is ready and quiz questions are set up, you can generate a unique link to share your profile. Send this link to your friends via social media, messages, or directly.

### 4. **Friend Takes the Quiz**

When your friend clicks the link:

- They can choose to answer the questions anonymously or with their name.
- They’ll go through the quiz based on the questions you added to your profile.

### 5. **Score Calculation**
